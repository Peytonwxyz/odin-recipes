   <h1> Granny's Dirt Cake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dirt cake might not sound appetizing but it's actually the easiest and most delicious dessert. An Oreo crust is topped with a cream cheese pudding mixture and then sprinkled with more Oreos for good measure. It's an easy no bake dessert we wish we kept in our refrigerators all year. This cake version is very similar to Dirt Pudding which is made in individual cups and chocolate pudding -Makinze Gore</p>
